# Investigate a Dataset Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Investigate a Dataset project!

**Author:** Victor M. ADELEYE

**Project:** Investigating The Movies Database Collection

This project involves analyzing the TMDB (The Movies Database) dataset to answer questions related to movie features, ratings, commercial possibilities, and budgets.

## Files

- `investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `tmdb-movies.csv`: Dataset file (replica of the original TMDB dataset from Kaggle).

## Project Structure

- **Introduction:** Brief overview of the TMDB dataset and the questions explored.
- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyzing the dataset and answering research questions.
- **Conclusions:** Summarizing key findings and insights.

## Research Questions Explored

1. What are the top 10 movies with the highest budget?
2. Which movies are the most sold (highest revenue)?
3. What are the top 10 most profit-yielding movies?
4. What are the top 10 rated movies?
5. Which genres are the most common over the 56 years in the dataset?
6. Which genres are the most common genres in the most popular movies?
7. Which genres are the most rated genres over the 56 years?
8. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
9. Are there movies with high budgets but low ratings?

## How to Use

- Open and run the `investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis.
- The dataset file `tmdb-movies.csv` is required for running the notebook.
